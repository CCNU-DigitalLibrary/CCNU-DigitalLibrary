# Resnet detection of wrong labels in labeled data set

## Usage

This algorithm is well suited to validate labelled images obtained with web scrapping, untrusted sources or colloborativly generated labels.



## How does it work

This approach separate our image directory between two classes, inliers, and outliers, by describing the images with the bottlenecks
values generated by the end of the convolution phase of a pre-trained CNN, like 'inception-v3' or a MobileNets, for faster computation. 

These values are then fed to a clustering algorithm to get a prediction. To increase performance, some values of random images are precomputed, and added during the fit of our classifier.



## Basic Usage

Just run the ImageSetCleaner.py and pass the location of the directory you want to detect like so :
`python image_set_cleaner.py --image_dir=./foo/LocationLabelDir/`

You will then see a GUI pop up where you will be able to fine tune the detection and delete/move the selected outliers.
